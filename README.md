The aim of the project was to improve the multi-label retinal image classification pipeline to better detect diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration from fundus images.
Model performance was optimized by fine-tuning pre-trained CNN backbones. Classification accuracy was improved through evaluation of appropriate loss functions and ensemble learning.
